# QuickChemDraw
A quick and convenient way to draw chemical formulae when a whiteboard or pen / paper are not readily available. Submitted as my class project for CS 64A at foothill college. At this stage it isn't much more than a drawing app with a hexagonal grid to help guide the drawing of six-membered rings.

## Todo

- support vertical and horizontal scrolling to accomodate large structures
- improve compatability of the canvas background with various screen sizes
- allow structures to be saved locally to the device.
- drag-and drop features for common atoms and functional groups
- enable snapping of structures to the grid
