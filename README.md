# QuickChemDraw
A lightweight semi-scientific calculator for Android. Written from scratch for my own uses because my own android device did not come with a calculator app.

At the same time I wanted to test the knowledge I had gained from both my android development and data structures / algorithm courses.

## Todo

- add square root functionality

- fix layout parameters to be responsive for smaller screen sizes and tablets
